# System-Integration-2022-Assignment-2-Mini-Project-1-WS-and-SOA


The assignment demands use of at least one REST-service and one SOAP-service.

Via REST-services we verify a persons gender based on their name and country based on their IP. 

https://gender-api.com for the gender based on name
http://ip-api.com for the country based on ip

Via SOAP-services we get a persons phone extension based on the country.
